a.Name two differences between imperative and functional programming.

ANS --> Imperative programming uses a sequence of statement to reach to any certain goal whereas 
functional programming is a pure functional approach. Many lines in imperative changes the 
state of program but in functional approach all those are replaced by single functional call.



 
 b. Explain the meaning of declarative programming. Give an example.
Functional programming is declarative programming. Focus what to do, not how to do.

ANS--> Declarative programming is a programming style where it is responsible for building the structure and
 elements of computer programs ,that expresses the logic of a computation without describing 
 its control flow.
 
 Example: 
 
 Function<Integer,Integer> add1 = x -> x + 1;
 
 Here, we have used declarative programming using functional approach  where an integer is passed and returned with 1 increased.
